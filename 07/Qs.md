# Advanced Concepts in Three-Dimensional Graphics 🎨🖥️🔺

## Introduction 🎭📐🕶️
Three-dimensional (3D) graphics extend two-dimensional (2D) representations by incorporating depth, enabling realistic simulations and visualizations in fields such as gaming, scientific modeling, and virtual reality. Unlike 2D graphics, 3D graphics use three coordinates (x, y, z) to define objects in space, allowing for intricate transformations, lighting, and rendering techniques.

## Coordinate Systems 🏗️📊🧭
3D graphics utilize two primary Cartesian coordinate systems:
- **Left-handed coordinate system:** The positive z-axis extends away from the viewer.
- **Right-handed coordinate system:** The positive z-axis extends toward the viewer.

To determine the orientation of the z-axis:
1. Point the fingers of your **left or right hand** in the positive x direction.
2. Curl them in the positive y direction.
3. The direction of your thumb indicates the positive z-axis.

## Objects and Mesh Structures 🏗️🧩🖌️
### **Vertices, Faces, and Meshes**
- A **vertex** is a single point in 3D space defined by (x, y, z) coordinates.
- A **face** is a polygonal surface that connects multiple vertices.
- A **mesh** is a structured set of vertices, edges, and faces that defines the geometry of a 3D object.
- The **triangle mesh** is the most common representation due to its computational efficiency in rendering and processing.

### **Normals and Shading** ✨💡🔦
- **Face normals** are perpendicular vectors to a polygonal surface, crucial for shading calculations.
- **Vertex normals** are interpolated values that allow for smooth shading transitions across connected polygons.

## 3D Transformations 🔄📍🌀
Transformations enable object manipulation within a 3D scene. These are mathematically represented using matrices.

### **Translation** 📌📏🔼
Moves an object along the x, y, and z axes:
\[ T = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & T_x \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & T_y \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & T_z \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \]

### **Scaling** 📊🔍📈
Adjusts the size of an object relative to the origin:
\[ S = \begin{bmatrix} S_x & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & S_y & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & S_z & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \]

### **Rotation** 🔁🔄⏳
Defines rotation about an axis:
- **X-axis rotation:**
  \[ R_x = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & \cos(\theta) & -\sin(\theta) & 0 \\ 0 & \sin(\theta) & \cos(\theta) & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \]
- **Y-axis rotation:**
  \[ R_y = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(\theta) & 0 & \sin(\theta) & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ -\sin(\theta) & 0 & \cos(\theta) & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \]
