# Introduction to Computer Graphics 🎨✨🖥️

## 1. Overview
Computer Graphics (CG) is an interdisciplinary field that encompasses the generation, manipulation, and visualization of visual content through computational methods. It integrates principles from **mathematics, physics, and computer science** to produce graphical representations of data and objects. With applications spanning diverse industries—such as **interactive entertainment, scientific simulation, engineering design, and artificial intelligence**—computer graphics is a fundamental domain within modern computing. Advances in computational power, rendering techniques, and artificial intelligence have significantly expanded its capabilities, enabling real-time rendering, photorealistic simulations, and immersive virtual environments. 🎮🖌️💡

## 2. Importance of Computer Graphics 🎥🕹️🖼️
The study of computer graphics is essential due to its transformative impact on numerous fields:
- **Entertainment and Media:** Feature films, television productions, game development, and virtual production pipelines rely on advanced graphics techniques for realism and immersion.
- **Scientific Visualization:** High-fidelity visual representations of complex scientific phenomena, such as molecular dynamics, astrophysics simulations, and medical imaging.
- **Engineering and Design:** Applications in **Computer-Aided Design (CAD), architectural visualization, and product prototyping** streamline development cycles.
- **Medical Imaging and Bioinformatics:** 3D imaging techniques such as **Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)** and **Computed Tomography (CT)** scans aid in medical diagnostics and research.
- **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning:** AI-driven techniques such as **neural rendering, style transfer, and generative adversarial networks (GANs)** are revolutionizing content creation.

## 3. Fundamental Concepts 📊🔢🎭
### 3.1 Definition and Scope
Computer graphics is the computational representation and manipulation of visual data. It is classified into two primary types:
- **Raster Graphics:** Pixel-based images stored in a matrix format (e.g., JPEG, PNG), commonly used for digital images and textures.
- **Vector Graphics:** Resolution-independent graphics defined using mathematical equations (e.g., SVG, PDF), suitable for scalable illustrations and typography. 🖍️🖼️📐

### 3.2 Display Parameters 📏🖥️🔍
- **Pixel:** The smallest addressable unit in a digital image, serving as a fundamental building block for raster graphics.
- **Resolution:** Defined as the number of pixels along the width and height of an image (e.g., `1920×1080`).
- **Aspect Ratio:** The proportional relationship between width and height (e.g., `16:9`).
- **Color Depth:** Measured in bits per pixel, dictating the number of colors an image can represent (e.g., 24-bit color supports 16.7 million colors). 🎨📊🌈

### 3.3 Rendering and Shading Techniques 🖌️✨💡
Rendering is the process of generating a 2D image from a 3D model through computational algorithms. Key techniques include:
- **Rasterization:** Converting geometric data into pixel data for display.
- **Ray Tracing:** Simulating light behavior for photorealistic shading and reflections.
- **Global Illumination:** Advanced lighting calculations that simulate natural light behavior.
- **Shading Models:** Includes Phong, Gouraud, and physically based rendering (PBR) techniques for accurate material depiction. 🕶️🔦📸
