# Chapter 6: Mathematical Foundations of Game Animation and Physics 🎮📊🕹️

## 1. Introduction 📚🔢🎮
Mathematics is a cornerstone of modern game development, providing the foundation for realistic physics, motion, and animation. This chapter delves into essential mathematical principles used in graphics and animation, including **vectors, transformations, coordinate systems, parametric curves, and animation techniques**.

## 2. Linear Algebra in Game Development 🧮🖥️⚡
### 2.1 Understanding Vectors 📏🔄📐
A **vector** is a mathematical entity characterized by both **magnitude and direction**. In game development, vectors play crucial roles in defining:
- **Object positions** in a virtual space.
- **Directional movement** and aiming.
- **Velocity and acceleration** for dynamic simulations.

For example, a position vector **(3,5,2)** indicates an object's placement:
- **3 meters east**, 
- **5 meters upward**, 
- **2 meters north**.

### 2.2 Position Representation via Vectors 🌍📌🎯
Vectors serve as coordinate descriptors in **2D** and **3D spaces**, helping define object positions relative to a chosen reference point.

### 2.3 Vector Operations ➕➖✖️
#### **Vector Addition & Subtraction** ➕➖📉
Vectors are added or subtracted component-wise:
$$ A + B = (a_x + b_x, a_y + b_y, a_z + b_z) $$
$$ A - B = (a_x - b_x, a_y - b_y, a_z - b_z) $$
Example in **Python**:
```python
import numpy as np
A = np.array([3, 5, 2])
B = np.array([1, -2, 4])
C = A + B  # Vector addition
D = A - B  # Vector subtraction
print("C:", C, "D:", D)
```

#### **Scalar Multiplication** ✖️💡🎛️
Scaling a vector by a scalar modifies its magnitude:
$$ kV = (k \cdot v_x, k \cdot v_y, k \cdot v_z) $$

#### **Dot Product** 🎯⚡📏
A measure of directional similarity between two vectors:
$$ A \cdot B = a_x b_x + a_y b_y + a_z b_z $$

#### **Cross Product (3D Only)** ➗📌🔀
The cross product yields a vector perpendicular to two given vectors:
$$ A \times B = (a_y b_z - a_z b_y, a_z b_x - a_x b_z, a_x b_y - a_y b_x) $$

### 2.4 Coordinate Systems in Games 🌐🖥️📊
- **Model Space**: Defines an object’s local coordinate system.
- **World Space**: Represents the global coordinate frame.
- **View Space**: Defines coordinates relative to the camera.
- **Screen Space**: Represents the 2D projection of 3D elements.

## 3. Parametric Curves 🔄📈🌀
### 3.1 Bezier Curves 🎨✏️📐
Bezier curves facilitate smooth interpolations between points.

---
## 4. Game Programming Fundamentals 🎮💾📜
### 4.1 Game Loop Mechanism 🔄💡🕹️
A conventional game loop executes continuously:
```python
while game_running:
    process_inputs()
    update_game_logic()
    render_graphics()
```

### 4.2 Frame Rate Independence with Delta Time ⏳🎞️🔄
Maintaining consistent movement across different frame rates:
```python
delta_time = current_time - previous_time
position += velocity * delta_time
```

---
## 5. Animation Techniques 🎥🎬🖌️
### 5.1 Frame Rate & Keyframing 🎞️📸🎭
- **Standard FPS**: 24 FPS is commonly used.
- **Keyframes**: Define major motion states.
- **Inbetweens**: Fill intermediate frames between key states.

### 5.2 Linear Interpolation (LERP) 🔀📍💫
LERP facilitates smooth transitions:
```python
def lerp(A, B, t):
    return A + t * (B - A)

pos = lerp(0, 10, 0.5)
print("Interpolated Position:", pos)
```

---
## 6. Collision Detection 🚀🎯💥
### 6.1 Bounding Box Intersection 📦🔄📍
Detects whether two rectangular objects overlap:
```python
def is_colliding(rect1, rect2):
    return not (rect1.right < rect2.left or rect1.left > rect2.right or rect1.top > rect2.bottom or rect1.bottom < rect2.top)
```
